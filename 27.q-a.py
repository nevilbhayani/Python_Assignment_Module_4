# â€¢ What is used to check whether an object o is an instance of class A?



# In Python, you can use the isinstance() function to check whether an object is an instance of a particular class. The isinstance() function takes two 
# arguments: the object you want to check, and the class (or a tuple of classes) you want to check against.
