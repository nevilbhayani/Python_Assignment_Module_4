# What relationship is appropriate for Course and Faculty?


#  The appropriate relationship between a "Course" and "Faculty" can be represented as a many-to-many relationship. 
#       This means that multiple courses can be taught by multiple faculty members, and each faculty member can teach multiple 
#       courses.
